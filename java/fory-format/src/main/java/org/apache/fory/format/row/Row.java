 * Interface for row in row format. Row is inspired by Apache Spark tungsten, the differences are
 * <li>Use arrow schema to describe meta.
 * <li>String support latin/utf16/utf8 encoding.
 * <li>Decimal use arrow decimal format.
 * <li>Variable-size field can be inline in fixed-size region if small enough.
 * <li>Allow skip padding bye generate Row using aot to put offsets in generated code.
 * <li>The implementation support java/C++/python/golang/javascript/rust/etc..
 * <li>Support adding fields without breaking compatibility in the future.
