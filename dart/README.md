# Fory Dart

## Overview

This PR adds Dart language support to Apache Fory, implementing a comprehensive serialization solution for Dart and Flutter applications. Fory Dart consists of approximately 15,000 lines of code and provides an efficient serialization mechanism that works within Flutter's reflection limitations.

## Implementation Approach

Dart supports reflection, but Flutter explicitly prohibits it. To address this constraint, Fory Dart uses a combination of:

1. Core serialization/deserialization logic
2. Static code generation for type handling

This approach ensures compatibility with Flutter while maintaining the performance and flexibility expected from Fory.

## Features

- XLANG mode support for cross-language serialization
- Reference tracking for handling object graphs
- Support for primitive types, collections, and custom classes
- Serializer registration system
- Code generation for class and enum serialization
- Support for nested collections with automatic generic type conversion
- Custom serializer registration
- Support for using ByteWriter/ByteReader as serialization sources

## Usage Examples

### Basic Class Serialization

```dart
import 'package:fory/fory.dart';

part 'example.g.dart';

@foryClass
class SomeClass with _$SomeClassFory {
  late int id;
  late String name;
  late Map<String, double> map;

  SomeClass(this.id, this.name, this.map);

  SomeClass.noArgs();
}
```

After annotating your class with `@foryClass`, run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

This generates the necessary code in `example.g.dart` and creates the `_$SomeClassFory` mixin.

### Serializing and Deserializing

```dart
Fory fory = Fory(
  refTracking: true,
);
fory.register($SomeClass, "example.SomeClass");
SomeClass obj = SomeClass(1, 'SomeClass', {'a': 1.0});

// Serialize
Uint8List bytes = fory.toFory(obj);

// Deserialize
obj = fory.fromFory(bytes) as SomeClass;
```

### Enum Serialization

```dart
import 'package:fory/fory.dart';

part 'example.g.dart';

@foryEnum
enum EnumFoo {
  A,
  B
}
```

Registration is similar to classes:

```dart
fory.register($EnumFoo, "example.EnumFoo");
```

## Type Support

Fory Dart currently supports the following type mappings in XLANG mode:

| Fory Type                  | Dart Type                                       |

## Project Structure

The implementation is organized into three main components:

1. **Codegen**: Located at `dart/packages/fory/lib/src/codegen`
   Handles static code generation for serialization/deserialization.

2. **ForyCore**: Located at `dart/packages/fory/lib/src`
   Contains the core serialization and deserialization logic.

3. **ForyTest**: Located at `dart/fory-test`
   Comprehensive test suite for Fory Dart functionality.

## Testing Approach

The test suite is inspired by Fory Java's testing approach and includes:

- **Data Type Tests**: Validates custom data types implemented for Dart
- **Code Generation Tests**: Ensures correctness of the generated static code
- **Buffer Tests**: Validates correct memory handling for primitive types
- **Cross-Language Tests**: Tests functionality against other Fory implementations
- **Performance Tests**: Simple benchmarks for serialization/deserialization performance

### Running Tests

Tests use the standard [dart test](https://pub.dev/packages/test) framework.

To run tests:

```bash
# First, generate necessary code
cd fory-test
dart run build_runner build

# Run all tests
dart test

# For more options (skipping tests, platform-specific tests, etc.)
# See: https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/README.md
```

#### Additional Configuration

Inside the `fory-test/test_config` directory you will find YAML configuration files required by certain tests (for example, the `cross_language` tests).
Before executing those tests, please review and adjust the configs in `fory-test/test_config` (or provide your own) so that they match your environment.

## Code Quality

Fory Dart maintains high code quality standards. You can verify this using:

```bash
dart analyze
dart fix --dry-run
dart fix --apply
```

## Current Limitations

- Only supports XLANG mode (priority was given to cross-language compatibility)
- No out-of-band buffer functionality
- No data type compression (e.g., String compression)
- Generic parameters in user-defined types can be serialized but require manual type conversion after deserialization
